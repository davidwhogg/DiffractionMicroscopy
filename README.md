## Projects
- Infer the real-space or full complex FT from a (noisy, censored)
measurement of the squared modulus only, plus perhaps some
onstraints (like non-negativity or compact support).
- Consider cases of Gaussian and Poisson noise.
- Consider cases where we get (noisy, censored) two-dimensional
Ewald-sphere slices of (the squared modulus of) the Fourier
transform, and we don't know the Euler angles for any of the slices!

- Let's go fully Bayesian if we can.
