## Comments

- The problem of inferring the phase of a Fourier transform
(of, say, an image) from an observation of the squared-norm
of that Fourier transform comes up in problems of
**x-ray diffraction** and **diffraction microscopy**.
In principle it also might arise in **adaptive optics**.
- The problem is analogous to (or identical to, in some sense)
inferring a function from an **observation of its auto-correlation**.
- We will concentrate on methods that involve
either explicit **optimization of a justified objective function**
or else some kind of probabilistic inference.

## Projects

- **Simulated annealing:**  This is probably not a good idea!
- **Aligning noisy two-dimensional slices** of the Fourier Transoform:
In some experiments, the data is taken in many short (and hence noisy)
exposures, and the sample orientation is not known for any of the
exposures.  Can these data oriented and combined accurately?
